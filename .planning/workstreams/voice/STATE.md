# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-16)
Workstream: voice (Person B). Roadmap: .planning/workstreams/voice/ROADMAP.md

**Core value:** A blind user can complete a real web form by voice and trust it: Blip never submits anything without a full read-back and a distinct spoken confirmation phrase, and that gate lives in deterministic code the model cannot bypass.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Spikes and Push-to-Talk Loop

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Spikes and Push-to-Talk Loop)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-16 — Voice roadmap created (4 phases, 28/28 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Shared Milestones

| Milestone | Target | Voice phase | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| M0 protocol frozen (voice signs off) | ~h0.75 | 1 | Pending |
| I1 walking skeleton | ~h6–8 | 1 | Pending |
| I2 end-to-end with gate (fake brain OK) | ~h12 | 2 | Pending |
| I3 real Claude + real form + repair + injection blocked | ~h20 | 3 | Pending |
| Freeze, tag `demo-safe` (backup video ~h36) | ~h30 | 4 | Pending |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in the PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting the voice track:

- [Roadmap]: Voice builds against `apps/voice-ui/dev/mock-server.ts` until I1 and never blocks on core
- [Roadmap]: Grammar first. Unmatched utterances become a `parseIntent` effect (core BRAIN-02)
- [Roadmap]: Half-duplex audio. The confirm phrase is matched in server code; the voice UI never decides
- [Pending, Phase 1 spikes by ~h3]: voice-window layout; PTT route (uiohook-napi hold vs `chrome.commands` toggle); NVDA route (controller DLL via koffi vs in-page live region)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Install NVDA (2026.2) on both machines before the NVDA spike
- Voice sign-off is needed at M0 (~h0.75); it blocks both tracks
- Unverified (LOW confidence): Web Speech recognition and speechSynthesis while the voice window is unfocused. Phase 1 spike
- The team-owned public form (Google Form) must exist by ~h12 so core can test it before I3
- Speech audio goes to Google STT, so use only fictional data in the demo profile
